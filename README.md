Modern Portfolio Theory, examine how past performance does not result in future performance.

I chose a random selection of 5 Dow Jones companies from before the GFC.  GM was not included because it went bankrupt and
I cannot find price data from this time period, only post bailout.

This is intended to show that optimization does not help investments in this simple scenario.  This scenario is optimizing
a selection of stocks for portfolio allocation in the runup to the great financial crisis of 2008.  Then I follow this
allocaton for the following 18 months to see the results.  This rarely shows positive results.

Ways to investigate further
I could monte carlo this to see what best possible result would be or how often the portfolio ends positively
Another would be to include a bond fund to move our mean and variance down the line for sharpes ratio we can get a better result,
this may necessitate a longer time frame because bonds really shine when stocks collapse.
I will probably not investigate these though.
Another interesting thing to look at is a very long term index fund asset class analysis.  Others have done this
and long term data is less reliable or available.

I don't use Modern Portfolio Theory, but it is very interesting statistically.
